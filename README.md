# ProjectMald

A simple game made by 2 idiots: a code monkey and an art monkey.

How to build and run the game:
if you already know how to use git/visual studio, this should just run in vs using the default debugger


If you aren't familiar with the dev tools and just want to run the game:
 - Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 - can be found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads
    -  Make sure you installed the "Desktop development with C++" option when installing VS
 - Make sure you have vcpkg - can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
 - Use the built in VS tools to clone and import the project into VS automatically, or just clone the repo and open the .sln file in VS
 - Press F5 to run, or press the button with the green triangle that should say "Local Windows Debugger" (If it doesn't say that, there's a dropdown to the right where you should be able to change it)
